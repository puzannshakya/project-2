Remarkably, a single hectare of potato yields two to four times the food quantity of grain crops, showcasing its water-efficient nature, outperforming other major crops by up to seven times. Potatoes are cultivated in more than 100 countries worldwide.",

    description: "Onion is a biennial plant but is usually grown as an annual. Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm. In the autumn, the leaves die back, and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is normally harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear, and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The inflorescence takes the form of a rounded umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross-section.",
